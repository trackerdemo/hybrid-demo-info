## Inspecting

Inspecting a webview is very important while development/testing in order to debug a website to check it's network, dom, run some js, etc. It can be a little hard to debug a website running in a webview as it doesn't provide an inbuilt inspecting panel. Follow the steps below to inspect a website running in a webview:

- Android : [Remote Debugging](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/remote-debugging/webviews)
- iOS : [Enabling the Inspection of Web Content in Apps](https://webkit.org/blog/13936/enabling-the-inspection-of-web-content-in-apps/)
